Prerequisites:
Ensure that Kubernetes cluster is at least as new as v1.16 (to use admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1) or v1.9 (to use admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1)
Ensure that MutatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller is enabled.
You can check if it is enabled by looking at the admission plugins that are enabled by using the following command:
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
 
If not enabled, then you can enable this plugin by running the following command in kube-apiserver:
             kube-apiserver --enable-admission-plugins=MutatingAdmissionWebhook  
Ensure that the API (admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 or admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 depending upon the k8s version being used) is enabled by using the following commands:
For admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 API:
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
Output should be:
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
 
For admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 API: 
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
Output should be:
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
TLS Certificate Requirement
In Kubernetes, in order for the API server to communicate with the webhook component, the webhook requires a TLS certificate that the API server is configured to trust. Following are some of the ways in which you can configure the required TLS certificate.
Option 1:
The easiest and default method is to install the cert-manager. With this option, cert-manager will generate a self-signed certificate.
Option 2:
If you want to use the cert-manager but want to use your own issuer to generate the certificates, then you can go with this option.  
For that you need to set the mutatingWebhook.certManager.issuerRef.name property of the lm-webhook helm chart to the name of the issuer which is deployed in your Kubernetes cluster and you also need to set the mutatingWebhook.certManager.issuerRef.kind property to the kind of the issuer (Issuer or ClusterIssuer).
Both option 1 and option 2 need a cert-manager installed in your k8s cluster.
Option 3:
            If you want to generate & manage tls certificates for the lm-webhook on your    own, you can create the required certificate and key for the lm-webhook and manually create the tls secret in the same namespace where lm-webhook will be deployed. In this    case, you need to set mutatingWebhook.certManager.enabled to false, so that you don't need to set up cert-manager.
         Note: By default the service name of the lm-webhook is lm-webhook-svc. The    hostname to be used while creating the certificate should be of the form:
         <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
        Eg. lm-webhook-svc.lm-webhook.svc.cluster.local
Once you have the required certificate and the key files ready for lm-webhook you can follow below steps:
Create the namespace for the lm-webhook if not exists
                       kubectl create namespace lm-webhook
Create the tls secret in the same namespace
Default tls secret name consumed in the lm-webhook is lm-webhook-tls-cert. If you are using different name, then you need to pass it by configuring the value of the mutatingWebhook.tlsCertSecretName


 kubectl create secret tls lm-webhook-tls-cert \
   --cert=path/to/cert/file \
   --key=path/to/key/file \
   -n lm-webhook
 
Set the base64 encoded value of the CA trust chain to the mutatingWebhook.caBundle which will be used by the api-server to validate the tls certificates.
 
 
Getting started

Deploying the lm-webhook helm-chart
Depending on the certificate management you are using and the lm-webhook components like selectors and external configuration, you need to modify the helm command for the lm-webhook deployment. It is recommended to get the understanding of the selectors and external-config part, so that you can configure the lm-webhook properly. 
For all the possible values that can be configured with lm-webhook helm chart refer to configuration section <link to configuration section>
Helm chart for the lm-webhook is available at logicmonitor/lm-k8s-webhook/helm-chart/lm-webhook path.
The simplest lm-webhook deployment without passing any selectors and external configuration can be done by running the following command in bash terminal.
helm install --debug --wait -n lm-webhook \
--create-namespace \
--set cluster_name="<cluster_name>" \
lm-webhook .
 
 Deploying the application pods:
    Once the lm-webhook is up and running, you can deploy the application pods that you wanted to get mutated. If you have configured selectors i.e. Object selector, Namespace selector then you need to make sure that your pods and namespace should satisfy corresponding selectors. 
If everything goes well, then after the pod gets deployed, you can see that pod has the Kubernetes resource attributes as an environment variables injected into it.
