## TLS certificate setup

Following are some of the ways in which you can configure the required TLS certificate.

**Option 1**:
The easiest and default method is to install the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/). With this option, cert-manager will generate a self-signed certificate. 
> Note: Please make sure that the components (pods) deployed by the cert-manager are up and running. By default cert-manager deploys its pods in the `cert-manager` namespace.

---
**Option 2**:
If you want to use the cert-manager but want to use your own issuer to generate the certificates, then you can go with this option.  

For that you need to set the `mutatingWebhook.certManager.issuerRef.name` property of the lm-k8s-webhook helm chart to the name of the issuer which is deployed in your Kubernetes cluster and you also need to set the `mutatingWebhook.certManager.issuerRef.kind` property to the kind of the issuer (Issuer or ClusterIssuer).

Both option 1 and option 2 need a cert-manager installed in your k8s cluster.
> Note: Please make sure that the components (pods) deployed by the cert-manager are up and running. By default cert-manager deploys its pods in the `cert-manager` namespace.

---
**Option 3**:
If you want to generate & manage tls certificates for the lm-k8s-webhook on your own, you can create the required certificate and key for the lm-k8s-webhook and manually create the tls secret in the same namespace where lm-k8s-webhook will be deployed. 

In this case, you need to set `mutatingWebhook.certManager.enabled` to false, so that you don't need to set up cert-manager.

> Note: By default the service name of the lm-k8s-webhook is `lm-k8s-webhook-svc`. So, the server cert must be valid for `<svc_name>.<svc_namespace>.svc`

If you are following `option 3`, then once you have the required certificate and the key files ready for lm-k8s-webhook you can follow below steps:

1. Create the namespace for the lm-k8s-webhook if not exists

   ```bash
     $ kubectl create namespace lm-k8s-webhook
   ```
2. Create the tls secret in the same namespace

Default tls secret name consumed in the lm-k8s-webhook is `lm-k8s-webhook-tls-cert`. If you are using different name, then you need to pass it by configuring the value of the `mutatingWebhook.tlsCertSecretName`

   ```bash
     $ kubectl create secret tls lm-k8s-webhook-tls-cert \
      --cert=path/to/cert/file \
      --key=path/to/key/file \
      -n lm-k8s-webhook
   ```

3. Set the base64 encoded value of the CA trust chain to the `mutatingWebhook.caBundle` which will be used by the api-server to validate the tls certificates.

## Deploying the LM-K8s-Webhook
* Clone the github repo of [LM-K8s-Webhook](https://github.com/logicmonitor/lm-k8s-webhook).
* Helm chart for the `LM-K8s-Webhook` is available at `helm-chart/lm-k8s-webhook` path in the repo.
* Depending on the certificate management you are using and the lm-k8s-webhook components like [selectors](https://logicmonitor.github.io/lm-k8s-webhook/configurations/selectors/) and [external-config](https://logicmonitor.github.io/lm-k8s-webhook/configurations/additional-attributes-config/), you need to modify the helm command for the lm-k8s-webhook deployment. You can refer the [examples page](https://logicmonitor.github.io/lm-k8s-webhook/examples/).

* For all the possible values that can be configured with lm-k8s-webhook helm chart refer to [configuration page](https://logicmonitor.github.io/lm-k8s-webhook/configurations/configuration)
* The simplest lm-k8s-webhook deployment without passing any selectors and external configuration can be done by running the following command in bash terminal from the `helm-chart/lm-k8s-webhook` directory.

```bash
$ helm install --debug --wait -n lm-k8s-webhook \
--create-namespace \
--set cluster_name="<cluster_name>" \
lm-k8s-webhook .
```
