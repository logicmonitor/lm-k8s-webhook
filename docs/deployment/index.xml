      <description>TLS certificate setup Following are some of the ways in which you can configure the required TLS certificate.
Option 1: The easiest and default method is to install the cert-manager. With this option, cert-manager will generate a self-signed certificate.
 Note: Please make sure that the components (pods) deployed by the cert-manager are up and running. By default cert-manager deploys its pods in the cert-manager namespace.
  Option 2: If you want to use the cert-manager but want to use your own issuer to generate the certificates, then you can go with this option.</description>
